## 🌍 Welcome to My World!

👨🏻‍🔬 I'm a Machine Learning Scientist fascinated by the nexus of machine learning, health, and biology. I love working in academia and its intersection with industry, where I can bring ML innovations from theory to practical applications.

🧬 Currently, I am developing scalable causal inference methods especially applicable to genomics data at [DZNE](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/population-health-sciences/forschungsgruppen/mukherjee/research-areasfocus/). My journey has taken me from leading research projects at Amazon Alexa to consulting for AI startups like [sea.dev](https://www.sea.dev/).

🎓 I did my PhD in the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge under [Prof. Pietro Lio](https://caraml-group.github.io/author/pietro-lio/). My work focused on parameter and structural efficiency for deep learning with biomedical applications in mind.



## 🚀 Recent Adventures in ML
### 🧬 Postdoc Researcher at DZNE (April 2023 - Now)
Exploring scalable causal response predictions for genomic applications.

### 🤖 ML Consultant for [sea.dev](https://www.sea.dev/) (Feb - March 2024)
Integrated temporal graph embeddings for context retrieval from knowledge graphs for a LLM application.

### 🔊 Tech Lead at Amazon Alexa (April 2021 - Nov 2022)
Led a project that increased voice production speed by 3x-5x.

### 🎓 Research Internships: Amazon Alexa & MILA
Performed research in graph representation learning culminating in several publications. Obtained return offer from Amazon.
